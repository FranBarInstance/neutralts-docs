Neutral TS Web APP Example
==========================

Simple example of Neutral TS to create a Progressive Web Application (PWA) or Web APP, in Rust with Actix Web and for HTML design Bootswatch and Bootstrap. This example will show you how to create a template structure and how to do theming among other things.

It is not an example of Rust or Actix, it is not an example of design, it is an example of Neutral TS, so you can use this example as a prototype or as the basis of your own Web APP taking into account that what is really intended to illustrate is the use of templates.

Download from [repository](https://gitlab.com/neutralfw/neutralts/), the crate is here [neutralts](https://crates.io/crates/neutralts)

Rust
----

Navigate to the web-app/rust directory and then:

```
cargo run --release
```

A server will be available on port 9090

```
http://127.0.0.1:9090/
```

PHP
----

Navigate to the web-app/php directory and then:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

A server will be available on port 8000

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
(*) Requires an IPC server that you can download from the [repository](https://gitlab.com/neutralfw/ipc/-/releases)

Python
----

Navigate to the web-app/python directory and then:

```
export FLASK_APP=index.py && flask run
```

A server will be available on port 5000

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

IPC Server
----------

Navigate to the ipc directory and then:

```
cargo run --release
```

Performance
-----------

The example has all the elements of a production PWA, so it is a good approximation of real performance with a **4000MHz** CPU.
